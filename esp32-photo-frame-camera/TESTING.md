# Testing guidelines

All testing conventions live here. `CODE_GUIDELINES.md` and `WEBAPP_GUIDELINES.md` link here instead of duplicating.

## Core principles (all stacks)

- Treat tests as **first-class**: refactor them like production code; package **by feature** next to or mirroring feature layout.
- Name tests for **behavior** so failures read as documentation (story-style or `should_...`).
- Prefer **integration** over heavy mocking unless volume forces substitutes (real DB / HTTP app where practical).
- Prefer **linear** tests: setup → single act → assertions (optional cleanup); minimal branching in the act; avoid asserting incidental intermediate state.
- For **new behavior**, prefer a test that describes the public outcome; for **bugs**, add a test at the **deepest layer** that still reproduces the bug.
- **Unit tests** target a **unit of behavior**, not every class in isolation. **E2E** stays few and CI-aware.

**DO** — Behavior-named tests; assertions next to the action they validate; explicit setup when it aids readability.

**DON'T** — DSL-heavy layers that hide intent; mocking persistence in integration tests unless the test is about isolation.

When reviewing coverage gaps, use **Code review priorities** in `CODE_GUIDELINES.md`.

## Python — GivenPy + PyHamcrest

Prefer **[GivenPy](https://github.com/tadas-subonis/givenpy)** and **PyHamcrest**. GivenPy is a small BDD-shaped layer over pytest or unittest; PyHamcrest keeps assertions composable.

### Dependencies

```text
pip install givenpy PyHamcrest
```

(or declare the same in your project dependency file)

### Shape of a test

Every test should use **given → when → then**:

- **`given([...]) as context`**: list preconditions explicitly; compose from named steps.
- **`when`**: exactly **one** block per test — only the code **under test** (end-user or API client entrypoint). Split if you need more than one act.
- **`then`**: outcomes; prefer PyHamcrest **`assert_that(actual, matcher)`**.

### Setup steps

- Prefer **higher-order functions** that return step closures (e.g. `there_is_external_number(5)` → `def step(context): ...`).
- Use **`lambda_with(open, close)`** (GivenPy) for setup/teardown pairs (connections, temp dirs).
- Reuse steps across files (e.g. `tests/integration/steps_*.py`).

### Naming

- Good: `test_user_should_be_able_to_login`, `test_user_should_not_be_able_to_login_with_invalid_credentials`.
- Avoid: `test_login`, `test_invalid_credentials`.

### Assertions (PyHamcrest)

- Use **`assert_that(actual, matcher)`** consistently.
- **Custom matchers** for domain meaning; extract a **named function** returning a matcher when trees get nested.

**DO** — `given`/`when`/`then`; Hamcrest matchers; reusable steps.

**DON'T** — Multiple `when` blocks per test; business logic inside matchers.

**Assertion order** — Preconditions in `given`; outcomes in `then` in the order they become observable.

## TypeScript / Node — HTTP integration (Jest + Supertest or equivalent)

Default to **direct integration style**, not BDD/DSL scaffolding. A test reads like a short API scenario:

1. Create required data  
2. Call the endpoint  
3. Assert HTTP response  
4. Optionally verify persistence via a repository  

**Core rules**

- Plain `describe` / `it`, plain `await`, local variables.
- Put `expect(...)` **close to the action** it validates.
- Setup **explicit in the test body**; duplication is OK when it keeps tests independent.
- **Real repositories** for persistence checks; do not mock them unless the test is about isolation.
- Helpers remove **transport boilerplate only**; if you must read the helper to understand intent, it is **too heavy**.

**Assertion ordering**

1. Status code  
2. Key response body fields  
3. Persistence / repository state  
4. Downstream side effects  

**Scope** — One meaningful scenario per test. Long **flow** tests are OK when behavior is inherently sequential; keep chronological and assert only what belongs to that flow.

**Response shape** — Assert the **live** API shape, not a legacy `{ success, data, error }` envelope the route no longer uses.

**Migration rule** — Prefer new tests in this style; rewrite touched DSL-heavy tests when practical. **Do not** introduce new heavy Given/When/Then scaffolding for Node backend tests.

Example (paths illustrative):

```ts
import { setupTestServer } from "./testServer";
import { UserRepository } from "@/users/UserRepository";

const { get, post } = setupTestServer();

describe("Users API", () => {
  it("creates a user and persists it", async () => {
    const created = await post("/api/users", {
      username: "anna",
      email: "anna@example.com",
    });

    expect(created.status).toBe(201);
    const userId = created.body.id as string;

    const stored = await new UserRepository().findById(userId);
    expect(stored).not.toBeNull();
  });
});
```

### API / HTTP coverage (any backend)

For new or changed behavior, cover at least: happy path; auth / permission failures; important validation failures; not-found and conflict where relevant.

Schema changes **MUST** include migrations (when the stack uses them) and a test or CI step that applies them.

**DO** — `describe`/`it` + `async`/`await`; assert HTTP then storage.

**DON'T** — Frameworks that hide assertions; shared fixtures that obscure the scenario.

---

## Browser E2E (e.g. Playwright)

Write behavior-level coverage **before or alongside** features when possible; lock behavior after implementation.

### Goals

- **Page objects** encapsulate selectors and actions so steps stay stable when markup changes.
- **Step definitions** (if using Cucumber) stay thin: translate Gherkin into page object calls only.

### Suggested stack

- **Playwright** (or equivalent) for automation.
- **Page object** classes per main surface (page, modal, widget).

### Example folder layout

```text
tests/
  features/
    steps/
      checkout.steps.ts
      account.steps.ts
  pages/
    CheckoutPage.ts
    AccountSettingsPage.ts
  support/
    world.ts
    hooks.ts
```

### Example: steps

```typescript
import { Given, When, Then } from "@cucumber/cucumber";
import { CheckoutPage } from "../pages/CheckoutPage";

Given("I open checkout", async function () {
  this.checkout = new CheckoutPage(this.page);
  await this.checkout.open();
});

When("I apply coupon {string}", async function (code: string) {
  await this.checkout.applyCoupon(code);
});

Then("the order summary should show discount", async function () {
  await this.checkout.expectDiscountVisible();
});
```

### Example: page object

```typescript
import { Page, expect } from "@playwright/test";

export class CheckoutPage {
  constructor(private page: Page) {}

  async open() {
    await this.page.goto("/checkout");
  }

  async applyCoupon(code: string) {
    await this.page.getByLabel("Coupon").fill(code);
    await this.page.getByRole("button", { name: "Apply" }).click();
  }

  async expectDiscountVisible() {
    await expect(this.page.getByTestId("discount-row")).toBeVisible();
  }
}
```

### Frontend testing pyramid (default order)

1. **E2E** for real user journeys (Playwright or equivalent).  
2. **UI-layer functional** when full E2E is too slow (Testing Library, RN Testing Library).  
3. **Focused component tests** only for meaningful, hard-to-cover behavior.  
4. **Reducer / store unit tests** only when logic warrants — avoid by default.  

A good frontend test answers: *Can the user complete the flow? Does the right screen state appear? Do important controls behave? Does navigation complete?*

### Page object DO / DON'T

**Good page object** — One screen or clear UI area; user-level actions (`startNewSession()`, `submitFeedback()`); hides locators; `waitForLoaded()` / small user-level assertions; stays small.

**Bad page object** — Raw component internals; business logic or huge mutable context; a getter per element; names like `setStoreStateAndContinue()` or `runScenarioA()`.

Good names: `waitForLoaded()`, `enterFeedback(text)`, `selectArea(name)`, `clickStartExercises()`, `sessionComplete()`.

### Mocking

Mock **boundaries**, not the UI. OK: network/services, storage, AI calls, platform integrations. Avoid mocking components under test, navigation, or interactions you can drive for real.

Be very picky about what needs to be mocked. If not sure, do not mock. Always prefer full integration tests where we test full features. Never mock databases and internal services.

> Mock what crosses the app boundary, not what defines the user experience.

### Assertions to prefer

- Visibility; important **text**; **enabled/disabled**; **navigation** and completion; **visible errors**.  
- Avoid: internal hooks, private state shape, exact timing, mock call counts (unless the test targets that boundary).

### Test IDs

Stable `data-testid` / `testID` on meaningful controls. **Good:** `start-session-button`, `feedback-screen`, `submit-feedback-button`. **Bad:** `button-1`, `container-left`, `blue-card`.

### Selectors and naming

- Prefer **`data-testid`** (or role/label) over brittle CSS chains.  
- Align feature files with acceptance language from specs.  
- Reuse page objects for shared widgets (nav, tables, modals).  
- Test names describe user-visible behavior (e.g. `user can start a new session`), not `screen works`.

### Anti-patterns

- Reducer-only tests when a screen flow would cover the same logic.  
- Snapshot-heavy dynamic UIs.  
- Page objects that are trivial getters for every element.  
- Large fixture systems that hide the flow.  
- Ceremonial tests (`expect(true).toBeTruthy()`).  
- Proving render only, not meaningful outcome.  

Every test should prove a **user-visible** or **contract-level** outcome.

**DO** — Page objects for selectors/actions; assertions in specs; stable testids.

**DON'T** — E2E asserting global store implementation details; snapshots as default.

**Assertion order** — Arrange UI state → act → assert visibility/text/navigation in order of user perception.

## Choosing a style by stack

| Stack | Style |
|-------|--------|
| **Python** | GivenPy + PyHamcrest (`given` / `when` / `then`) |
| **TypeScript / Node** HTTP | Direct integration (`describe` / `it`, local `expect`) |
| **Browser** | Playwright + page objects (+ optional Cucumber steps) |

Shared goals: behavior-named tests, integration over pointless mocks, assertions near the action, no hidden DSL.
